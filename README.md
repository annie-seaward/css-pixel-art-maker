# Coming Soon: CSS Pixel Art Generator

Draw a design using the pixel art interface and export the CSS need to make it as a single div CSS.

Hoping to add in the future:

- Upload an image or take a webcam picture and convert it to CSS pixel art
- Share your finished creation to social media easily
- Other forms of CSS box shadow art
- login to save your creations
- Hall of frame: submit your art to be featured in the hall of frame
